# React Homework 1 - Todo App

## Requirements

- Using all the things we learned so far create a single page todo app in react
- The page should have a list of todos that are either unfinished or finished
- Each todo should be its own component and recieve props from the parent todo page component

- The todo data should consist of an array of todo objects that look like this:
  ```
  {
    id: figure it out
    text: string
    isFinished: boolean
    author: string
    priority: "high" | "low"
  }
  ```
- Make sure all the data above is properly rendered in the html
- Color the todo background depending on if the todo is finished or not ( red for unfinished , green for finished)
- At the bottom of the page show the total number of todos, total number of finished todos and total number of unfinished todos
- The page should have a header and a footer
- Add some form of icon like a checkmark for finished toods or x for non finished todos

## Bonus (Only if you want to practice class based state otherwise wait for hooks)

- Using state try to make it so that when the user clicks on a todo it will change from unfinished to finished
- Make sure when you finish a todo to update the counts at the bottom of the page
