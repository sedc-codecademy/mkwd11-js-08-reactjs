# Exercise: Todo List with Redux

## Requirements:

- Create a React application that implements a Todo List using Redux for state management.
- The application should display a list of todos.
- Each todo card should have the title of the todo and checkbox indicating their completion status, and "X" button.
- Users should be able to add new todos to the list.
- Users should be able to mark todos as complete or incomplete by toggling the checkbox.
- Users should be able to delete todos from the list (the "X" button).
- Implement a counter that displays the total number of todos and the number of completed todos.
- Use Redux to manage the state of the todo list.
- Create reducers, actions as needed.
- Implement the Redux store and connect the components as needed.

NOTE: We did not specify how you should structure you component or what properties you should have in the state of the reducer/s, it is up to you.
