# Welcome to Development with React 🚀

The goal of this subject is to lay the groundworks of one of the most used FE library, how can we develop apps using ReactJS, what are its main components and how do we use them.  On this course the students will be able to learn the following:

●	What is ReactJS
●	How to create components that are reusable
●	How to manage their lifecycle
●	How to write hooks
●	What is ContextAPI and how to use it
 
The course will last 10 modules and will consist of new concepts as well as exercises and workshop classes in order to get one's hands on the code that is learned in class. Hope you have fun and good luck 😉
